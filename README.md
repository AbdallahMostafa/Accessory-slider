# Accessory-slider 

- When you open the application, you will see a list of dog products displayed in a carousel format.
- Use the scrollbar at the bottom to scroll through the products horizontally.
- On desktop devices, a "You might find those interesting" text will be shown above the carousel.
- On mobile devices, a "Complete your dog look" text will be shown instead.
- Each product card includes an image, title, price, and an "Add to cart" button.

You can view a live demo of the Dog Products Carousel [here](https://abdallahmostafa.github.io/Accessory-slider/).
